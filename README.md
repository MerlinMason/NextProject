# NextProject

![ci](https://github.com/MerlinMason/NextProject/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

An mildly opinionated starting point for Next.js projects.

Because setting stuff up is boring and building stuff is fun.

-   Typescript
-   Tailwind (with JIT)
-   Heroicons
-   Eslint (with Airbnb, jsx-a11y etc)
-   Prettier
-   Jest (with Testing Library)
-   Cypress (with Testing Library)
-   Dependabot config
-   GitHub Actions CI config
-   Colocate tests and supporting files in /pages directory
